## About Vectorworks

Vectorworks, developed by **Vectorworks Inc. (a Nemetschek company)**, is a complete design ecosystem uniting architecture, landscape, and entertainment design under one roof.  

It offers **precision-driven CAD functionality** and **intelligent BIM modeling**, making it suitable for projects ranging from small residential designs to complex commercial structures. The software’s **Renderworks** engine (powered by Maxon’s technology) provides stunning visualization directly within the app — no exports required.  

Unlike traditional CAD tools, Vectorworks empowers designers to move fluidly from **concept sketches to construction documents**, maintaining geometry, metadata, and presentation quality along the way.  

From architects and interior designers to lighting and event planners, Vectorworks adapts to every creative discipline with modular tools and automation capabilities.
